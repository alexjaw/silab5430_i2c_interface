# silab5430_i2c_interface
Code that takes output from Silabs CBPro and uses it for configuration of the clocks on the Si5340D chip. Has been tested on RPi and i2c as protocol.

Build on RPi:

```mkdir cmake-build-debug ```

```cd cmake-build-debug/ ```

``` cmake .. ```

``` cmake --cmake-build-debug . ```

``` cmake --build . ```

Now there should be binaries to run.
